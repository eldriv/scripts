#+TITLE: Emacs shell Script
#+AUTHOR: Nycto
#+language: en
#+startup: overview

* Purpose
This script serves to run my development environment—Emacs that much faster than executing a lot of commands like going on my development environment—shell.nix, Emacs:
#+begin_src shell
$ cd ~/emacs-shell
$ nix-shell
$ emacs
#+end_src
Since I always use Emacs everyday it tires me to repeatedly doing commands above so I made a script to run my Emacs—development environment much faster than those commands.

* zshenv
Make sure your zshenv configuration has:
#+begin_Src shell
export PATH="$HOME/your-specified-path-for-scripts:$PATH"  
#+end_src
* Run script
#+begin_src shell
$ emacs-shell -h # Display help
#+end_Src
